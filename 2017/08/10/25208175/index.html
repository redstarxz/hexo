        <p>About more than half a century ago, “a kind of marriage form of polyandry” Tibet region or the more common, a family of that time a few brothers have a wife is very common and normal phenomenon, even a few years ago in Shigatse and Naqu area also can see the ancient marriage system and residual mark. Every nation has its own unique customs and traditions, as a bystander we have no power to Tibet this special experience all the time, because it is a specific product of a specific historical period, this is not what a shame. But to be honest, at that time, this form of marriage is the family and social stability has played a great role in promoting to be accepted by the majority of the working people.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/0B14D52C6B09449F70331CD7EC8A30D227184C97_size77_w835_h1000.jpeg" alt="0B14D52C6B09449F70331CD7EC8A30D227184C97_size77_w835_h1000.jpeg"><br>To be exact, the “polyandry” in Tibet is the most common and common form of “brothers and wives”, and the other is “father son co wives”, but it is very rare. From the general law of social development, any system is closely related to the social environment at that time. It is no accident that such a marriage system can appear in Tibet before liberation. No one can say when this form of marriage began, but the general view is that the Tibetan people adopt this marriage primarily to prevent property outflows. Tibet is in the era of Serf Liberation, the underlying needs of the people in the household as the unit to paying taxes to the government and ministers, if brothers regardless, then no matter how many family members, are calculated according to a user, this time the brothers together to marry a wife is the best way to solve the problems, so “polyandry” also came into being.<br><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/D0768B28B4ECFFB67CA242E4E73595732BDA3C25_size35_w750_h457.jpeg" alt="D0768B28B4ECFFB67CA242E4E73595732BDA3C25_size35_w750_h457.jpeg"><br><a id="more"></a><br>There is a view that women earn less than men’s ability to marry home, too many women is a burden and the burden, and the brothers in their family to division of property, so Tibetans prefer to marry a wife. From our growth environment, monogamous marriage is the most It is quite common for, see “polygamy” is also from the costume drama, then this “polyandry” is exactly what kind of family structure set up? How do you get along with each family member?</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/B8D3CC0D3DCB408BCBE2956392174FB6EBEA4FA5_size39_w623_h628.jpeg" alt="B8D3CC0D3DCB408BCBE2956392174FB6EBEA4FA5_size39_w623_h628.jpeg"><br>Contrary to the conventional wisdom of many people, the wife of the family of polyandry is not only at the bottom of the family, but occupies an important place. Generally speaking, when the husband’s family to her own style will advance that girl is married brothers, all age etc.. But the girl before getting married will have a special account to improve the elders after marriage between brothers together, not biased that occurred between the brothers jealousy thing. If a family daughter-in-law good husband and you will be in harmony, and the village people think is virtuous and kind-hearted wife, well when the family; conversely, if a daughter to marry after the past make your husband the rift, or to her husband to take care of their not fair enough and will inevitably be treated equally chuojilianggu, that is a bad wife and reputation.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/117C76B49C4C879D64377BFA430C1F426CE23860_size190_w1000_h1499.jpeg" alt="117C76B49C4C879D64377BFA430C1F426CE23860_size190_w1000_h1499.jpeg"><br>Several lives in a house husband together with a wife, according to the general logic should be not jealous of each other and conflict, but the fact is that the “polyandry” family harmony beyond our imagination, even more than a lot of monogamous family more harmonious. The wife must be absolutely fair in her diet, dress, work and sexual life, otherwise, the pressure of public opinion will be enough to keep the woman from lifting her head. Husbands, however, are divided into families responsible for the services and livelihood of their families, and in common respect and love for their wives.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/2A1E1685CA8B577F29DAF090C9980DAD5DB026E9_size93_w910_h910.jpeg" alt="2A1E1685CA8B577F29DAF090C9980DAD5DB026E9_size93_w910_h910.jpeg"><br>Married to her husband’s wife in the day, generally held a grand wedding ceremony, the groom may be the eldest brother, there may be several brothers together at a wedding. Usually, if a young brother, the brother as a blind representative and the bride, marriage by her brother and sister-in-law then on the day of the wedding, such as brothers will grow up at the right time and right by the name of the wife, husband is in fact her husband. And if the brothers have few differences in age, then several brothers at the scene of the wedding scene is not without. In fact, some of his disqbility inconvenience to attend the wedding, also let the younger generation to salute; even some of the brothers age are too young, also let the father to the wedding. In short, exactly what form to adopt and no fixed routine, or according to specific circumstances.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/C6A1F2BE73AD3BDD4DAD9FA03D8AEF4AAABA78A6_size52_w910_h610.jpeg" alt="C6A1F2BE73AD3BDD4DAD9FA03D8AEF4AAABA78A6_size52_w910_h610.jpeg"><br>In the sexual life with the husband, the rotation system is generally accepted as a form, after all, the wife can not be based on their preferences, but should be treated equally. Tibetans in the sense of marriage are comity and equality between men and women, cold war, separation, betrayal, discord and so on are not allowed. Every day in between the family there is no need to hide and suspicion, the wife can completely and to which her husband openly expressed in the table, can be in the intersection, even at family gatherings. And the husband who is going to sleep with his wife can also take no notice of it, or even make it widely known as a reason to push off some farm work and recreational activities. The usual practice is that her husband will do a their own shoes or other what things hanging in the entrance, so that other people will see how to leave. Of course, this method is not absolute, to stay together morning and night’s family, a look, a movement, or even an expression might convey enough information, so when a husband with others also went to consciously avoided.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/E8174175585FF3864EF4BC1AA393A8416EA4D72E_size88_w1000_h946.jpeg" alt="E8174175585FF3864EF4BC1AA393A8416EA4D72E_size88_w1000_h946.jpeg"><br>The wife born child, your husband to raise and share, no one will try to understand the child in the end who is her husband, for them, this is their common child. In the title, some families have the big brother called “father”, while the other brother called as “Uncle”; some families simply put a few brothers are called “father”, but no matter what call, in the hearts of children, “father” are equally important components.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/9863783E3EE66A6DDA60F0AA02F1B98BCBFE6388_size76_w910_h903.jpeg" alt="9863783E3EE66A6DDA60F0AA02F1B98BCBFE6388_size76_w910_h903.jpeg"><br>In the course of thousands of years of human evolution, the form of marriage begins with no taboos and forms various forms. It is always closely related to production and life. Tibet’s “polyandry” system is ultimately before the liberation of the region’s economic and cultural backwardness, with the popularity of the progress of the society and the education, this form of marriage also will perish after all, love is selfish, how can love sharing?<br>This article is from Phoenix, representing Phoenix from the media point of view.</p>
