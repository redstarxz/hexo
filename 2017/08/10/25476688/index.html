        <p>Original title: another example of excessive interpretation: AIDS vaccine will come? It’s still early!<br>It’s too long to see<br>1, this is an important study. So far, only 4 HIV vaccine concepts have been tested for human effectiveness in the world so far, and Johnson’s vaccine will soon become the fifth.<br><a id="more"></a><br>2, however, “producing an immune response” does not mean achieving effective protection and prevention of aids.<br>3, this study is still in its early stages, large-scale clinical trials have not yet been done, and the listing will take longer.<br>4, wear a suit, wear a suit, and wear it.<br>Author: Er vermicelli<br>Edit: Odette<br>Today, several media reports, Johnson announced in July 24th the world’s first HIV vaccine human clinical trials “,” volunteers of HIV vaccine was well tolerated, and produced antibodies against HIV 100%”. Therefore, also received a lot of friends on the phone, ask the news, and some of them are infected, it seems that the vaccine will be listed in two days.<br>For a while, the mood is complicated. On the one hand, it was good to see the public’s concern about the disease, the prevention, and especially the vaccine; on the other hand, worried about the negative effects of misunderstandings about the findings, and decided to talk about it.<br>To put it simply, this is not the first human vaccine in the world to test HIV vaccines, and it is also a relatively early result. Having volunteers produce an immune response does not mean that the vaccine can prevent aids. From the really wide range of AIDS vaccine, we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/5F44469FD391AB8425F78ADBA4BCB691CFA99345_size53_w640_h426.jpeg" alt="5F44469FD391AB8425F78ADBA4BCB691CFA99345_size53_w640_h426.jpeg"><br>Photograph: 123rf.com.cn<br>This experiment<br>What does that really mean?<br>In July 24th, the results of an early clinical trial known as APPROACH appeared at the Ninth International AIDS Society conference in Paris. This test is based on the “mosaic” AIDS vaccine project participants, including the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa and Thailand in 393 healthy adults, they were randomly assigned to receive one of the 7 kinds of vaccine or placebo (note to vaccinated subjects is not a virus, but after processing and verification of security the vaccine in animal experiments), completed the 4 dose vaccination in 48 weeks before the two dose as the basis for immunization, after two doses as immunization. The results showed that different mosaic vaccine inoculation protocols were well tolerated (no adverse reactions) and could produce an immune response to HIV in healthy adults. What is worth mentioning is that in previous animal studies, the most protective vaccination program produced the greatest immune response in this trial.<br>In the big reports, the claim that 100% produced antibodies against HIV is not accurate. The original results only refer to a cellular response or an antibody response, which does not indicate that the antibodies produced by the vaccine are effective against hiv. Therefore, some “against AIDS no longer need condoms” title is entirely misreading.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/33DE4E6D7BF46AAF4EF76C421EE5DA4150D07C27_size101_w1102_h609.jpeg" alt="33DE4E6D7BF46AAF4EF76C421EE5DA4150D07C27_size101_w1102_h609.jpeg"><br>Photo:healthline.com<br>The immune response we usually refer to is a series of defensive reactions produced by the body against foreign substances or variants of its own components. In most cases, this immune response produces a self-protection effect to achieve the goal of eliminating the alien, but producing an immune response is not equivalent to achieving effective protection.<br>For example, when our eyes are in the sand, we may blink and shed tears. That’s a reaction, but can this reaction clear the sand? Maybe - tears are pouring out of the sand, but it may not. Therefore, responding does not mean that it can resist foreign substances.<br>Therefore, the ability to initiate an immune response to HIV does not necessarily mean that the vaccine regimen could prevent the infection of hiv. The success of the main role is for the next implementation of further clinical trials to assess the vaccine to provide support, as the chief researcher APPROACH Dan Balloch (Dan Barouch), said: “the early research results of this study support further evaluation of these vaccine candidates, to estimate its ability to protect susceptible population for the hiv.” And a of this scheme for the study of TRAVERSE is expected to be completed by the end of 2017, at the same time, clinical trials in a larger population in the plan, such as the smooth progress, is expected in late 2017 or 2018 to recruit subjects.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/F168B019C3D712F3908A1D052568726D6A0776DE_size23_w640_h235.jpeg" alt="F168B019C3D712F3908A1D052568726D6A0776DE_size23_w640_h235.jpeg"><br>Clinical trials go through several stages, each with different aims, subjects, and durations. The trial is still in the 1/2a phase. Photograph: cancerinstitute.org.au<br>There is a part of the data also caused widespread concern: “subjects single exposure to the AIDS virus (HIV) infection risk was reduced by 94%, and there are 66% people in the 6 exposure to HIV is still protected, not infected by HIV.” In fact, this part of the data is for monkeys, not for human trials. In an animal trial of the previous vaccine, one of the effective vaccination programmes reduced the risk of infection by a single exposure to SHIV by 94%, and 66% of the monkeys remained infected after six exposures. Notice, monkeys here. They’re not infected with HIV, and they’re using SHIV, a recombinant virus of SIV and HIV.<br>Sum up:<br>This study is an early population trial of a new vaccine that is still in its early stages;<br>The results of the study are optimistic and indeed play a crucial role in the development of HIV vaccines;<br>The results of the study need to be confirmed by further large-scale clinical trials;<br>The vaccine caused an antibody response in the human body, but it does not say the vaccine could fight HIV or aids.<br>How difficult is the HIV vaccine?<br>More than 30 years ago, scientists discovered the HIV virus, but until now, there is still no vaccine effective against the virus. Not without trying, but with difficulties.<br>Vaccine development from the process of listing to itself is very long, and for the HIV vaccine, it is even more difficult.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/75992393DCB212A63BCB16FAF794B41F639AB2C8_size143_w1280_h719.jpeg" alt="75992393DCB212A63BCB16FAF794B41F639AB2C8_size143_w1280_h719.jpeg"><br>HIV virus mainly attacks the immune system of the human body, and the process of producing antibodies is inseparable from the immune system, the immune system damage, immune dysfunction, is often the main reason for vaccination failure. So far, there has been no case of self-healing after HIV infection, which may indicate that the HIV system alone is unable to suppress and eliminate the virus.<br>This is not the worst. Our body’s resistance to HIV relies mainly on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (cytotoxic, lymphocyte, CTL), which secrete a variety of cytokines that are involved in the immune response. In the fight against HIV, its main function is to kill the cells invaded by the HIV virus, thereby terminating the breeding of HIV. However, none of the vaccines we currently develop can effectively activate it.<br>Variation in the virus is also an important factor in vaccine development. The HIV virus is not only very fast but also has an amazing reproductive rate (producing 1 billion new viruses per day). The traditional vaccine research and development approach is difficult to solve this problem, we must change the way of thinking, another way to develop HIV vaccine.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/ADCBA1F24400202011D81BD4D0E8A29FD9D43CCB_size17_w840_h513.jpeg" alt="ADCBA1F24400202011D81BD4D0E8A29FD9D43CCB_size17_w840_h513.jpeg"><br>The incubation period of AIDS for years or decades is a major resistance to vaccine research and development. Because, in such a long incubation period, HIV infection has always been there, the susceptible population of HIV (in fact, almost all of them) have continued exposure risk of long-term, even developed HIV vaccine can produce protective antibody, but whether in the long-term threat that can hold a need to consider the issue.<br>This is not the first HIV vaccine to enter clinical trials, but there is still no vaccine available, and the absence of a suitable HIV animal model is also an important issue. The current animal models are monkeys, but they are not infected with HIV, so they can only be tested with the SHIV virus. As a result, even if the animal test works well, the human body may not be that way.<br>How far is the HIV vaccine from us?<br>There are many kinds of HIV vaccines in the research and development phase, some of which are prophylactic vaccines to help the immune system prevent infection, and some are therapeutic vaccines to help the infected people clean up the infection.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0809/9F36DC746D030CFF2212CE14179DC219D56F6506_size28_w640_h494.jpeg" alt="9F36DC746D030CFF2212CE14179DC219D56F6506_size28_w640_h494.jpeg"><br>9 kinds of HIV vaccine design icon, starting from the top left, clockwise order of the inactivated virus vaccine, synthetic peptide vaccines, recombinant virus vector vaccine (the mosaic vaccine is such), DNA vaccine, broadly neutralizing antibodies, virus like particles vaccine, recombinant bacterial vector vaccine, subunit vaccine and attenuated vaccine. Photograph: hvtn.org<br>Dan Balloch said, their research has completed 1 clinical stage and 2A stage, it is proved that the vaccine is safe for humans and can produce antibodies in the human body; the next stage 2B will aim to verify these antibodies is really effective, enough to inhibit the effects of HIV. To date, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested on human effectiveness in the world, and their vaccine will soon become the fifth.<br>This mosaic vaccine is indeed a very promising one at the moment, but even if phase 2B clinical trials are successful, 3 trials and longer assessments will be available for future marketing. In other words, the distance from the real can be widely used AIDS vaccine, is still far from it?.
