        <p>Original title: what place Chinese elephant Association, the most prolific eunuch<br>What kind of condition and environment, is the hotbed that produces eunuch? Is Hebei really rich in eunuchs?<br>This paper, from the Han cable<br><a id="more"></a><br>Where did Chinese ancient eunuchs come from? “Hebei” must be the most common answer, especially in the surrounding areas of Beijing.<br>Hejian Prefecture, Baoding Prefecture, Sanhe County, Xianghe County, and so on, belong to Hebei province today. They are widely considered as the main producing areas of eunuchs. In the southern city of Langfang, the city was crowned with the name of “the hometown of Chinese eunuch” because of the famous eunuchs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, such as Wang Chengen and Li Lianying.</p>

So, in the official history and some private work, also many records of the background and origin of some eunuchs.<br>Such as the Ming Dynasty eunuch, there are one hundred and nineteen eunuchs, native or private history books recorded in the official history.<br>Of course, they are just a drop in the bucket of the Ming Dynasty eunuch – mid Ming Jiajing palace eunuch “has been up to tens of thousands of people. In the later period of Wanli reign, the number of eunuchs was more than twenty thousand and continued to increase. When the Ming Dynasty was destroyed, one hundred thousand people were said to have been there, and most of them did not leave any traces in history.</p>

Including Feng Bao, Wei Zhongxian, Wang Zhi Yan right like this, but also because of personal qualities, or achievements related to major historical events in the middle and lower eunuch.<br>Therefore, the records of their native place are more random and are not disturbed by any human choice factors. As a sample, they can reliably reflect the general distribution law of the native place of eunuchs in Ming dynasty.<br>In the 42 one can test the eunuch through the first half of the Ming Dynasty, 7 from North Zhili, roughly equivalent to today’s Hebei region, accounting for 16.7% of the total number.</p>
<p>![6348E7EF49CDE79F8910B18C9E0DF6F410E9872D_size418_w1003_h1421.jpeg][]<br>Man of the Ming Dynasty North Zhili map<br>In addition, the early Ming Dynasty eunuch is a major source of North Korea, “Annan” vassal state tribute, and prisoners of war in Ming Dynasty and foreign war or pacification four captive. Therefore, there existed a large number of non Chinese and non mainland eunuchs in the first half of the Ming dynasty.<br>If you remove these foreign eunuchs, only mainland Chinese origin of the Han people, from the Beijing Tianjin Hebei region accounted for about 30% of the eunuch.<br>From the Ming Dynasty Chongzhen Jiajing to the second half of the Beijing Tianjin Hebei: 77 through one more productive eunuch can test, there are 67 people born in Tianjin, accounted for 87% of the total number.<br>The 72 from the Ming Dynasty Eunuch in the northern province, 48 people born in Baoding Prefecture, and Hejian Shuntian palace and other capital area, mostly in the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin and today in Hebei province.<br>By the Qing Dynasty, the number of eunuchs in the palace, more than ninety thousand from the late Ming Dynasty, was cut to about 9000. The Qing Dynasty is strictly prohibited eunuch politics, the eunuch palace is completely slaves, not appear such as Liu Jin, Wei Zhongxian as the previous generation government dominated by the eunuch.<br>Therefore, the records of Qing Dynasty eunuch, more than the lack of the Ming Dynasty, even in the “history of Qing Dynasty”, have not set up a special “eunuch like biographies of official history”.<br>However, people familiar with the Qing Dynasty eunuch, are all born in Zhili area, that is, today’s Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei area.</p>
<p>![135DFDDCAA9879C740A1D90960C32C96FF273EC0_size399_w999_h1421.jpeg][]<br>Man of the Qing Dynasty Zhili map<br>For example, Li Lianying County native Shuntian Zhili (now the city of Langfang County of Hebei province), andhi origin Zhili Tianjin house Nanpi county (now Nanpi County of Cangzhou City, Hebei province), Djokovic Zhang Zhili Tianjin native house Jinghai county (now Tianjin city Jinghai District), hometown of Cui Yugui River between Zhili (now Hebei Fu Hejian County Hejian City) etc.. Sun Yaoting, also known as “the last eunuch in China”, was also born in Zhili County of Jinghai.</p>

This “good” is a helmet on voluntary ingredients, sometimes there is fierce competition.<br>For the convenience of investigation and choose the nearest syndrome, “Liang Shi” eunuch into the helmet also often are born in the Tang Dynasty near Changan capital area.</p>
<p>![02A3D6DF0E32ED343E710837E3E2CE1AE72768D9_size99_w1205_h854.jpeg][]<br>The main distribution area of the Tang Dynasty eunuch from man, both in Changan and Luoyang “two” around Beijing<br>The Song Dynasty was similar to the Tang dynasty. In the historical data, there were 34 eunuchs in the Song Dynasty who had a clear record of the place of origin. The Kaifeng eunuch accounted for 21 people, accounting for about 62% of the total. For example, the end of the song is called “one of the six thieves, treacherous eunuch Tongguan, is native.<br>The eunuch really fixed, born in Henan and the state, in the Central Plains region, is accounted for all the native can test the number 88% Song Dynasty eunuch.<br>You can see from the Han Dynasty to the Tang and Song Dynasties, the Ming and Qing Dynasties and even later, a eunuch from origin to textual research, are at the center of the region from the capital city and the capital city, or close enough to the radiation area.<br>Moreover, the closer the times are, the closer the eunuch’s native place is to the capital, so that the native place is the eunuch of the local capital.<br>Since ancient times, many eunuchs do<br>Therefore, the “Hebei” is popular in the eunuch, and not because of the people in Hebei and the surrounding areas of Beijing residents have serious “or” servile, love the palace for the emperor and court services, but because of Baoding, such as Shuntian palace and Hejian house of this region is the capital and the emperor recently distance place.</p>
<p>![A78994E6B341FEA0124855AFB7E2EA63A65AB59A_size71_w1124_h746.jpeg][]<br>Man left for China last eunuch Sun Yaoting (1902-1996), the Jinghai County West Shuangtang Village (now Tianjin city Jinghai District)<br>Due to the growth in the capital to language and local residents close to the emperor, do not have to worry about poor communication; don’t have to spend too much time and energy to adapt to meet the climate, living habits and eating habits, can better into the palace service faster, less likely because they do not adapt to the environment or living habits sick and dying.<br>Therefore, for the sake of efficiency and cost, the court will be more inclined to recruit eunuchs who come from the native place and are close to the capital in geography.<br>On the other hand, as “good” in his helmet system embodied as the capital of nearby residents, the eunuch in the palace when the eunuch system, procedures and when the eunuchs can bring benefits, will have a more intuitive understanding, clear and practical.<br>During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, people even competed for the castration of their children into the palace. In the capital area, it caused the “eunuch” to be more atmosphere, so that local produce more eunuchs.</p>
<p>![D31D47C292E188436B1924096683162D9C20A5C9_size121_w1271_h974.jpeg][]<br>Mature man in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty official of Beijing local chronicles literature in the “imperial examination” in the daily news, recorded the local people for “non blessing” and will give birth to the son in the palace when the eunuchs castrated phenomenon.<br>In addition, the surrounding ancient capital are often densely populated areas of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Gyeonggi province (North) Zhili area not only densely populated, and often only when agriculture is a kind of industry, it is easy because of natural calamities and man-made misfortunes or more people and less land, and fall into poverty and hunger.<br>At this time, nearby the palace “and” dry “when husband Huang poor” is also a can save lives, eat meal, even a chance of successful in the official career.<br>Therefore, no matter what Chinese in history of the era, the eunuch the main origin is the capital of the surrounding capital area.<br>But we are also the most familiar, the two longest since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and its capital is precisely Hebei, surrounded by a long, impoverished and densely populated Beijing.</p>
