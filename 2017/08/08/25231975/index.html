        <p>Because graduates of accidental death in the “pyramid” became the most dazzling word these days in the news.</p>
<p>In August 6th, 5 people involved in the Li Wenxing case were arrested. The campaign to eliminate illegal pyramid schemes has been launched in Tianjin, playing the slogan of “decisive battle for 20 days”, hitting the long plagued cancer with a heavy fist”.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/056DADD41014F15E29B1EDDECC39D676A77207C9_size103_w997_h476.jpeg" alt="056DADD41014F15E29B1EDDECC39D676A77207C9_size103_w997_h476.jpeg"><br>Tianjin Changan nets today’s home page</p>
<p>This morning, @ Peace Xiqing briefing, people feel more heavy. On the same day that Li Wenxing’s body was found, another young man, Zhang Chao, who had strayed into a pyramid scheme, was found dead in Tianjin, Xiqing.<br>Behind the boy died, many topics were provoked, including the cruel reality of college students to find a job recruitment website, there is a major default, countless, banned mlm.</p>
<p>As long as the conditions are available, anyone is likely to be cheated<br>Some people find it difficult to understand why the educated people fall into such an absurd routine and lack the sense of self-protection? Is it really being bewitched by the “dream of getting rich”?</p>
<p>The victim blame is cruel, fraud is the pyramid, the “knife Kanxiang”. The weak people here are not referring to the vulnerable groups, they may just slip into a predicament, may be due to asymmetric information and mistakenly into the trap, they are likely to be you, my friends and relatives around me.</p>
<p>Last week, Tencent released an anti fraud charity video titled “experiments for smart people.””. People who pretend not to be deceived may see silence and reflection after watching the video.</p>
<p>“Stupid”, “cheap”, “low IQ”, “low education.””…… These are the labels that the public puts on those who are deceived. In fact, the victims of telecommunications fraud cover all ages, cultural and professional levels. MLM is the same, anyone can become pyramid schemes, fraud targets, and whether to fall into it, sometimes only in an idea.</p>
<p>Private anti MLM Li Xu in an interview with the Beijing News, said such a sentence: deception and deception, and IQ, education has nothing to do. As long as the conditions are available, anyone is likely to be cheated. (reference reading: has been deep in MLM development, relatives do offline him, how to become the “people first anti MLM”?</p>
<p>How terrible is pyramid selling? People who have not experienced it are hard to empathize with, and may even have the survivorship bias to laugh at and despise those who have gone astray. But once in that environment, cut off contact with the outside world, was forced to accept high strength brainwashing, like feet stepped into the mire, it is difficult to get out.</p>
<p>Readers of the German film “wave” should remember the story: the history teacher asked the students if the dictatorial rule was possible in modern society, and the students scoffed. However, after three days of simulation experiments, the students were brainwashed by authoritarian ideas, and even developed into uncontrollable situation, leading to tragedy.</p>
<p><img src="http://p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/04F45491FF62E5ECAD37FDB1AF9B3259F41B1504_size30_w460_h276.jpeg" alt="04F45491FF62E5ECAD37FDB1AF9B3259F41B1504_size30_w460_h276.jpeg"><br>From media reports and the witness tells you can see hidden MLM organizations and fierce, and people in brainwashing and tips are also constantly upgrading.<br>Pull the trick escalating, generating main goal of University<br>1., the main goal is to change from rural migrant workers to young college students</p>
<p>Today MLM is “looking for a target”, usually through QQ group and recruitment websites. “Past MLM pull is acquaintances, now are strangers, dating, net chat, travel, recruitment, casually cheat.”.”</p>
<p>Obviously, there has been a great change in the victim population. In the past, mainly rural working youth, now dominated by college students.</p>
<p>Anti MLM people, Lao Wang rescued hundreds of people cheated, of which 80% are college students.</p>
<ol>
<li>people can easily seduce, BOSS direct hire lie most easily<br>Beijing time interviewed several rescued from “debell” who, according to them, through the network marketing organization have accounted for more than 9, of which BOSS direct hire the best early, basically rely on female people, sex can easily come to cheat. MLM organizations to select new people have a set of standards: “too poor, not too rich, do not marry, do not have foreign debt, not in the fugitives.”.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Their common recruitment platform is BOSS direct recruitment and Chinese talent network, in addition to “home” and “new”, everyone inside do so, every day from 6 in the morning to 10 at night to sleep. Because they are reluctant to pull their friends, so they pull strangers online.<br>Reference reading: MLM defectors can easily pull: seduce BOSS direct hire lie most easily</p>
<p>In addition, there is a type of pyramid scheme escalating, follow the hot spots of the times, under the name of philanthropy or Internet banking coat, change face, continue activities. This type of model because new, more elusive, one careless deception.<br>Violence + brainwashing, pyramid schemes destroy people’s will<br>The pyramid is divided into northern and southern factions, the North sent pyramid by beating, restriction of personal freedom as the basic means, South marketing focuses on the spirit of freedom of movement control, marketing personnel. For the victims in MLM scam, whether it is in school or North South, are unpredictable abyss.</p>

<ol>
<li>dens such as garbage heap, the writing on the wall “Losers are always in the wrong”<br>MLM dormitories are no lights, roof damage, bedding laid directly in the mud, jeans, cards, handbags, snakeskin bag, toothbrush discarded. In a room of 30 square meters, the dark and damp room, cockroaches scurrying, exudes a deep sense of smell. More than 10 boards erected a debris wrapped in a quilt, have not see the original color. The beam hanging ring into a white cloth, Poxian dark.</li>

Three meals a day are steamed, pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>The house is full of soup “dens wall paper”: “passion achievements dream”, “life is too short to be brave. Laugh, Carpe diem.” There are also some marketing notes and formulas.<br>Reference reading: Jinghai 13 years from the end of the pyramid! Such as dens of garbage, the writing on the wall “Losers are always in the wrong”</p>
<ol>
<li>job advancement and the temptation to increase income</li>
</ol>
<p>MLM participants, due to the continuous feel from the promotion and increase the income of the spell, as Skinner’s mice, in order to pursue more reward, will abandon the rational thinking, in which more and more crazy. In fact, the illegal pyramid scheme is a variant of Ponzi scheme, and its core mode is consistent.</p>
<p>This model mainly relies on the absorption of new members and the redistribution of old users. When new users are able to expand rapidly, participants at the top of Pyramid can enjoy incremental gains.</p>
<p>3., monitor, control personal freedom, and even hit people</p>
<p>MLM organizers watch, control personal freedom, and even start hitting people. Earlier, someone borrowed the toilet, shouted “help”, was hit on the ground, residents and landlords heard the police, all the gangs were taken to the police station.</p>
<p>In addition, the new membership, the first mobile phone control, each call, the whole process of staring, once used up, immediately take away. The new couple will be “soft” to prevent new people from talking or running away with other people.</p>
<ol>
<li>thinking and emotional control</li>
</ol>
<p>MLM is the slogan mad, they put all the concept of slogans and slogan, such as “five four dry industry”, the six “killer”, “three”, for the cause of the achievements of the “golden rule” and the “six big mentality”, with the people of the “more than 3 treasures”…… These slogans are loud, bold and heroic, with an undeniable arrogance. The greatest use is to format the human brain, so that members of the idea of unity, in unison, never want to think.</p>
<p>MLM organizations will try to manufacture and cultivate the sense of fear, make people afraid to leave, afraid of the outside world, afraid of my own mind, all trying to leave the people, are denounced as “coward”, “counseling package”. At the same time, members of the relationship between the strict rules, and even legal husband and wife can not live through husband and wife, lovers can not hold hands, intimate.<br>Reference reading: undercover MLM 23 days: I see how smart people are brainwashed, wash silly</p>
<ol>
<li>deprivation of dignity</li>
</ol>
<p>China fangpian alliance have been introduced back propagation the worst case, a college student was sent north into MLM organizations for 7 days, he recorded his own experience: live, live kennel gutter, eat bad food, beatings, nose irrigation, extortion money, everything. Daily and they play the game is: who lost, who lick a trouser crotch.</p>
<p>The victims of these schemes are different.</p>
<p>Some are completely brainwashed, put too much or not willing to give up, indulge in the “fortune” “successful” dreams; some hardships, escape from the snare, remember once the encounter is still a lingering fear; some are family money out, or in campaigns to be saved, the end of the day to muddle along without any aim……</p>
<p>But those who died so young but never come back.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0808/A74EDA9B6F066CD670E8692BF3EE7E667B44CD81_size28_w640_h" alt="A74EDA9B6F066CD670E8692BF3EE7E667B44CD81_size28_w640_h356.jpeg"><br>Moon-Sing Lee</p>
<p>As for the “evil” that lingers on the top of the common people, the departments concerned need to do something to suppress the living space of illegal pyramid schemes. And we have to be aware of the mind. For individuals, they must not lose the ability to think independently, and be wary of the enthusiasm of strangers and the phrase “overnight wealth”.</p>
<p>At the cost of life, the dead boy in the pond, empty stomach, showed the public a terrible and hideous appearance of pyramid selling. I hope this tragedy will not repeat itself.<br>This article is from Phoenix, representing Phoenix from the media point of view.</p>
