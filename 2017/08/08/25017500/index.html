<li>why are Cai Yingwen ready to run for life?<br>Commentary / three Shan map / from the network<a id="more"></a>
According to the Taiwan China network reported: according to Taiwan media reports, the morning of 4, 9 from the implementation of the “2017 political and military exercises for a period of three days, including the leader of the Taiwan authorities’ attack, the preventive coping in the details of the Taiwan Defense Department is not open. Los Angeles writer questioned, do not know a military, not clear what called cruisers, destroyers and aircraft carriers; do not understand the difference between Marines and special forces; cannot read missiles, missiles, bombs, rockets put a discrepancy between people, really can command armed forces, to fight in coordination? So how to take the lead, morale? Have seen, heard the captain of my first jump out of it?<br>In addition, each exercise was simulated at the leader’s office by XXX, challenging how to escape from the scene in the shortest possible time. What would this be like in the hearts and minds of the officers and men of the armed services? Look in the eyes of the people, this is where the courage to stand, commander of the armed forces and willing to die.<br>Los Angeles also mentioned, every time I see Cai Yingwen wearing helmets, wearing body armor like infrared shielding, neither majestic nor mighty, bluntly “if I was a soldier, I do not mind that at the end! What’s more, with the force of asymmetric” enemy “operations, whether it is for” independent “or war. In order to maintain her regime? In the past often indulge “feel green (“ awakening of the so-called youth “)” soldiers humiliated her, soldiers would be willing to sacrifice for her life?<br>Rocky’s views sparked a lot of sympathy. Users also criticized Cai Yingwen, “don’t want to talk to people and die”, “in the face of his people, she has escaped the” commander in chief “, if you encounter the Continental Army, if not to drill into the inside, every time do escape exercises, you can know this guy’s mind is what”, “hiding in the bulletproof chariot is of no use, do not afraid of the heat in the kitchen”, “as” head of state “is always in the study how to escape, said to let people have the confidence to raise morale, really is a” and “insight into There was no parallel in history. before he took office at the beginning of the drill, to escape the leaders”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>the KMT legislator Qiu Yi has issued a document before the pain, “it’s hard to imagine the people of Taiwan will elect such timid leaders.” He claimed that Cai Yingwen instructed the Taiwan Defense Department to do a “roaring exercise” after the Spring Festival, said Wanjun, is actually a “escape maneuver”. The post triggered netizens hot, Taiwan netizens said, Cai Yingwen “shame lost to the international”, “she is a waste, will only think how to escape.””. <em> </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a netizen from Taiwan said, “she (Cai Yingwen) is a waste and will only think how to escape.”” “Where do you want to go?” “Shameless”, “as a leader, do not know how to govern Taiwan, ready to flee.”!” This is also some netizens ridicule; “the darling of the runaway an irresistible force”. <em> </em></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>wanted to flee for life also reflects the insistence of the CAI authorities on the principled adherence to the one China principle and the readiness to escape”. <em> </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Cai Yingwen was aware of his stubborn adherence to the split position, and the final result was that he was arrested and was subjected to the trial of violating the anti secession law. Better catch before you are caught. <em> </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>the CAI authorities have become increasingly isolated in the world. At least 18 of the 20 so-called diplomatic relations countries in Taiwan have been queuing up to establish diplomatic ties with the mainland. The attraction of the world’s second largest economy will forever hold back Taiwan’s ability to retain its allies. The World Health Assembly has shut out the Taiwan region. The International Criminal Police Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Labour Organization have also taken a refusal attitude towards the Taiwan region. If Cai Yingwen continues to reject the “92 consensus”, the situation can only be worse. <em> </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Cai authorities so far are still reluctant to give up the “Taiwan independence” platform, is the biggest obstacle to the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, but also pose a threat to national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The party came to power last year, “to China” of the pace never stops, including the abolition of the lesson outline trimming proposal abolished the portrait of Sun Zhongshan, suspended for “Taiwan independence” a molecular anniversary, “public investment and reduce threshold, desalination method” to commemorate the independence day and the victory of the Anti Japanese War, cancel the tomb Yaoji tomb, reduce the class specifications, new Fiesta’s “de death” Chinese history. This series of “the of Taiwan independence” and “soft of Taiwan independence” acts more deceptive, is bound to the cross-strait relations have devastating effects, even in an attempt to “strengthen the arms, to resist reunification”. It constitutes a huge threat to the security of the Taiwan strait. <em> </em><br>Xi near <em> </em> president Ping attended the celebration of Chinese people’s Liberation Army 90th anniversary meeting stressed that in Beijing, “China people cherish peace, we will never engage in aggression and expansion, but we have the confidence to overcome all aggression. We will never allow anyone or any organization, any party, at any time, in any form, any piece of China territory split from Chinese, who do not expect us to swallow harm China’s sovereignty, security and development interests of the consequences.” <em> </em><br>This is <em> </em> last year near President Xi Ping again proposed the “six no”, fully display the strong will, against all separatist activities and a high level of confidence. Especially now the cross-strait relations for the authorities do not recognize the CAI reflected in the principle of “92 consensus” and stalled, and “six no” is the “Taiwan independence warning” molecules do not handle. <em> </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>in this case, Cai authorities know their doom has “countdown”, so in a constant state of anxiety are ready to escape, and”. <em> </em><br>In fact, the key in the release of <em> </em>, Cai authorities in their own hands, as long as give up the separatist stance, recognize the one China principle, what can talk to all the time, but also need to “escape”? <em> </em><br>This article is from Phoenix, representing Phoenix from the media point of view.</li>
