        <p>“Containment” will remain the long-term guiding ideology of the United States towards russia.<br>In August 2nd, President Trump signed the sanctions bill. This makes the United States Russia relations have been worse than ever, from bad to worse, to the freezing point in recent years. What would happen if anyone wanted China to pay for it?. Why is that?<br>Sanctions and “generosity””<br><a id="more"></a><br>From the end of 7, the house of Representatives and the Senate have passed a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North korea. The expected anger in moscow. In July 27th, Putin responded strongly: “it is impossible for the United States to live with it.””. 28, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement, cut down on the number of beauty’s diplomats, and from August 1st onwards temporarily Tingmei Embassy in Russia in the Russian part of the real property right of use.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0806/493CDBAE0C629758535BE93E68102D220351A8AC_size102_w1280_h853.jpeg" alt="493CDBAE0C629758535BE93E68102D220351A8AC_size102_w1280_h853.jpeg"><br>China News Agency reporter Liao Pan photo<br>August 2nd, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that after the U.S. president signed sanctions bill, Russia and the new U.S. government hopes to improve relations have come to nothing. Indeed, this round of interaction, the already tense relationship between the United States and Russia, has reached the freezing point in recent years. In this round of interaction, Russia in general appears to be more passive, in addition to fierce diplomatic speech, diplomats, diplomats have not yet seen other countermeasures.<br>It is always let people see the Russians vindictive rare generosity”. On July 28th, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed in his connection with US Secretary of state Tillerson that Russia did not wish to return tit for tat, but hoped that the United States would exchange its reflections on its policies. Russia is willing to normalize relations with the United States on the premise of mutual equality, respect and balanced interests, and cooperate on important regional and international issues.<br>Russian Foreign Ministry in August 2nd statement again mentioned that Russia and the United States sanctions against each other is not Russia’s choice, Russia is open to interaction with the United states. Obviously, this kind of Russia with enduring “generosity” shows that like most countries in the world, Russia’s value and hope to build good relations with the United states. Although the deterioration of this round of us Russian relations can be traced back to the deep Ukraine crisis with Russia, it has to be admitted that the current sanctions bill in the US Congress has touched the bottom of relations between the United States and russia. The United States President Trump that “the relationship between the United States and Russia are deadlock Lai parliament”, in fact is not full of angry words.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.ifengimg.com/w600/p0.ifengimg.com/pmop/2017/0806/D5E5D5F032EBCEF4588F88C7EE98FED91D894026_size162_w1280_h843.jpeg" alt="D5E5D5F032EBCEF4588F88C7EE98FED91D894026_size162_w1280_h843.jpeg"><br>The agency issued small Yan photo<br>Through Russia and anti Russia<br>How did the Russians offend the U.S. Congress? The direct cause is probably Trump in early July during the G20 conference and Putin talked for two hours, during the two hands back Poxian. The time has greatly exceeded the original plan. This makes the United States Constitution faction very angry. After Trump came to power, a series of “through Russia gate” scandal made Americans believe that Russia must have intervened in the United States presidential election, which affected the political ecology in the United states. Since then, this has First impressions are strongest, things inevitably again “that” people previously judged. Americans have always been meddling in other countries, but now they are being intervened by other countries, which Americans can not accept.<br>This is why the democratic and Republican parties rarely go forward and retreat, and unanimously sanctions against russia. But the bill, in addition to the provisions to continue to carry out large-scale sanctions against Russia, also emphasized that the president decided to suspend or cancel the sanctions against Russia must submit evaluation report to Congress, to prevent Trump to ease sanctions against Russia unilaterally. Without leaving a little chink, it can be seen that Americans are bored with Russia this time”.<br>Russian Prime Minister Medvedev’s observation is accurate, “the commercial interests of the United States have been placed aside, anti Russian hysteria has become a key component of the United States’ internal diplomacy.””. In fact, far more than commercial interests in the field of restrictions on weapons of mass destruction, the Middle East, international terrorism, the United States needs Russian coordination. But so decisive sanctions, the Russians will always blinded to the foot of the United States to face in the problem? At present, veteran Putin still leaves room. He said Russia would try to gain results with the United States on issues that are “quite difficult””.<br>Moreover, the American Congress’s hatred of the Russians is a mixture of discontent with Trump. This also follows the old adage in international relations that diplomacy is an extension of internal affairs. When the mountain within the United States struggle with the policy towards Russia wound together, that this knot half will unlock converting.<br>As chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee Sluckij said, though Trump had promised during his campaign to improve relations with Russia, but in fact, in the former Obama government to promote the anti Russian “flywheel” spin up did not stop, but in a more destructive direction acceleration.<br>Ukraine and Russia.<br>In addition, it is important to note that while focusing on the relationship between the United States and Russia, most have ignored the bill, requiring the State Council to work with Ukraine to strengthen the latter’s energy security”. This means that Ukraine is still an important factor in the relationship between the United States and Russia, not only caused the introduction of two sides against each other. From the traditional geopolitical theory, the United States still believes that Ukraine is an important part of the activities of the United States in the Commonwealth of independent states. A Russian without Ukraine, without the foundation of the Empire, would pose a serious threat to central and Eastern Europe and the West as a whole”.<br>To Russia and neighboring countries including Ukraine in tensions in Russia, around to create a “controlled” and “relatively stable” environment, the Russian way this America has his will continue: Russia more attention and resources, making it difficult to challenge us on other issues on.<br>At present, can be found, if in the current relations between the United States and Russia continue to orbit by inertia to develop, improve the converting short-term. Even if the political ecology in the United States straighten out, relations between the United States and Russia have changed, and their prospects will not be good. The description of Ukraine in the sanctions bill shows that “containment” will remain the long-term guiding ideology of the United States’ Russian policy.</p>

But if the hard temper, by external pressure, completion of domestic economic restructuring, something that is not a blessing in disguise, as Medvedev said the sanctions “in some ways but beneficial”. But there are Russians do not put their mind on hard work, but the eyes are eyeing other people’s pockets.<br>According to the Russian satellite news network reported that the director of the International Relations Department of the Russian Higher School of economics, University of International Relations, director of the Moscow Center for East Asian Studies and the SCO, “Wahl generation” club expert Alexander Lukin think, or to provide economic assistance to Russia to reduce U.S. sanctions China effect. The brain trust is so bold to ask for money, but it is not a case. Moreover, the idea of Lushi is not a sudden whim, but it comes from itself.<br>On the open literature have contacted the author and Russian scholars have seen, quite a few people believe that, in the past period of time, it is the United States to contain Russia, China has focused on economic development of great strategic opportunity. When high international oil prices fall from the clouds, Russia’s dream of becoming a world power is drifting away, and its “Eastern partner” has lagged far behind in the economy. A distorted mentality emerges: Russia is being used in co-operation with the “East partner” against the United States, and “Eastern partners” should compensate for it. Well, open mouth “Oriental partner” money to support, that is reasonable thing.<br>In view of this, a rising Chinese, indeed faced with how to make others – whether it is regarded as a strategic rival China countries, regarded as a strategic partner or problem Chinese countries comfortably accept the “rise” of this process and the fact that. Otherwise, that bulging purse is always a concern, but it is also a very troublesome thing.<br>You<br>Recommended reading</p>
